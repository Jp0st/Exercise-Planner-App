# Exercise-Planner-App

## I want to make a website that creates a workout plan
##    -It will have paramaters to allow the user to select:
##        -time
        -muscle group
          -up to 3 muscle groups
        -difficulty
        -sets
    -Depending on what is selected, an api will be called to randomly select the workouts
        -workouts should load before videos
    -There needs to be a button to reshuffle particular exercises
        -It should not have to reload the entire page every time
    -Make a call to youtubes API to gather an embeded video link
        -select the video based on keyword search and most viewed
        -videos should load lazy or have placeholders until fully loaded
    -Have radio boxes to mark exercises complete
        -Contain each workout in collapsable tabs
    Contain sidebar space for adds (optional)
Footer links to github and other socials

Site should be mobile first
