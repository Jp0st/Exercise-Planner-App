#Workout Planner

## Description

What?

We set out to develop a workout generator that selects exercises based on user selections and shows videos on how to complete those exercises.

Why?

With the ever growing list of tasks to accomplish during the day, we find ourselves having less time to go to the gym, much less plan a workout. We wanted to create something that would allow anyone, regardless of experience to be able to construct a quick, effective, targeted workout
to fit into their busy lives.

User Story:

AS AN individual with little time or knowledge to design a workout routine
I WANT to be able to generate a focused and effective workout plan
SO THAT I can spend more time doing the exercises rather than researching what to do


## Installation

Access the live application at https://jp0st.github.io/Exercise-Planner-App/ 
## Usage

The user when opening the application will be met with two dropdown forms. The first selects the muscle group they are looking to target and the second determines the intensity of the exercise they which to recieve. After submitting the form they are then redirected to a second page which has loaded three unqiue exercises which fit their parameters. After browsing the generated exercises the user can hit 'confirm' which will present a modal that displays once again the name and description as well as a video from youtube on the exercise they are currently on.  The progress bar at the top will track their current progress within the overall exercise plan, informing them when it is complete.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
